        "challenge" : "Companies will face one of the defining challenges of our time when they look to build, battling climate change through 'sustainability' and 'wellness.'  Unfortunately, these organizations must now wade through the acronyms and initials of sustainability and wellness rankings and their respective rating schemes to obtain a firmer grasp of where they stand and look to go with their sustainability and wellness efforts. Mostly, they are left perplexed.",
        "outcome" : "Piper is a smart assistant built to help companies discover, learn about, and compare sustainability and wellness frameworks across their building projects. NEXT, in conjunction with sustainability experts at HLW, created Piper to replicate an early engagement with a subject matter expert and guide companies down the right path as they strategize building, or to course-correct in late-stage planning. With Piper, we have invented a means to scale organizations' abilities to tackle climate change."

        "challenge" : "Fordham's new campus center was envisioned as the heart of their Rose Hill campus - a space for dining, recreation and fitness, and a beacon to welcome visitors and tell the unique story of the Jesuit university in the city. Building buy-in for the vision and its funding among students, faculty, alumni, and donors in the 10,000-strong historical campus would not be an easy feat for its leadership. How could we craft an experience to knit the Fordham community together around its leadership's visionary proposal?",
        "outcome" : "NEXT utilized immersive storytelling through its VR platforms to build visualizations that could be modified from within the experience in real-time. Together with Fordham's leadership, NEXT's Simulation team was able to craft and vet several narratives in real-time through workflows based on the Unreal gaming engine. Utilizing this approach, Fordham's leadership would co-author this mission-critical experience with NEXT and help steer it to success."
